##  What is a Bypass Code
A bypass code is a special code that allows users to bypass certain security measures or authentication processes temporarily. 
It is typically used in two-factor authentication (2FA) scenarios where a user may need to access their account but is unable to use their primary authentication method (e.g., lost access to their phone).
Bypass codes are usually generated by the system and provided to the user as a backup option. They are often single-use and have a limited lifespan to enhance security.

Definition:
Bypass codes are special codes that allow users to authenticate themselves if they cannot use their primary two-factor authentication (2FA) method. These are often used when users lose access to their 2FA devices.
Usage:
Bypass codes are user-specific and are typically a set of numerical digits.
They can be used to gain access to an account by appending the code to the user's password. This bypasses the need for a second factor, such as a mobile app or desktop app authentication.
Security:
Bypass codes are generally single-use and have a limited lifespan to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
They should be stored securely and only used when necessary.
